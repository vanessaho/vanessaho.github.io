It utilizes a recursive algorithm to travel through the board and find all potential words longer than three letters. This method ensures that there would be enough words to beat the required score and if not, the board will scramble until it does.</br></br>The user's credentials and progress are saved into a secure JSON file and are loaded back into the game if those same credentials are inputted.</p>

                            <p>WARNING: This is only optimized for mobile devices.</br></br>This is a web application built at HackHealth 2018, a hackathon stationed at Stony Brook University. My team and I won Best Fitness App for this little project but we did not have time to optimize it for non-mobile devices. Eventually, we thought it was hilarious to keep it as is since we had a good laugh at it on a laptop screen. </br></br>Fitr is a web application similar to Tinder where a user can find and match with a gym buddy to work out for the day; one can only chat with a matched user for only 24 hours before the union gets released.</br></br>Fitr is framed, colored, and animated with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In terms of its functionality, we used Firebase as our database system to collect all user information and store our SVGs.</p>

                            <p>Mangrove is a web application that I created during InnovateIT 2018, a hackathon placed at Stony Brook University. I wanted to build a fun little side project that would simulate a real web brokerage for people that want to invest in environmentally friendly and green companies, start-ups, ETFs, and others. </br></br>Mangrove forests are powerful ecosystems that thrive in brackish waters. They are home to thousands of organisms and house many baby fish with their inundated roots. The idea behind my Mangrove Application is that users should be able to responsibly invest in their future and build stable financial roots that can help the environment as well.</br></br>I used Python 3 to webscrape stock websites to extract green company names, their ticker symbols, and the category of "green" they belong in (ie: Solar, Wind, Electric). I used that information and compared it against stock APIs to create pages for that specific stock and graphed past prices since 2000.</br></br>Just for giggles, I created the front page using only JavaScript for DOM manipulation. I was not laughing very much.</p>
